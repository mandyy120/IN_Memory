# Accessing Our Application: User Guide

This guide will help you access our application even though it shows as "unverified" in Google's security screens.

## Why You're Seeing Warnings

Our application uses Google Drive to access your files, but it hasn't gone through Google's verification process yet. This is normal for applications in development or with a limited user base.

## How to Access the Application

When you click "Authorize Google" in our application, you'll see several security screens from Google:

### Step 1: "Google hasn't verified this app" Screen

## Is This Safe?

Yes, it's safe to proceed for these reasons:

1. The app is only requesting read-only access to your Google Drive
2. You've been specifically added as a test user by the developer
3. You can revoke access at any time by going to [your Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)

## Need Help?

If you're having trouble accessing the application, please contact the developer for assistance.

## Revoking Access

If you want to revoke access later:

1. Go to [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
2. Find our application in the list
3. Click **Remove Access**
