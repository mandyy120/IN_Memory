Secondly, it was suggested to implement a separate partition for logs in general to adhere to the same compliance requirements mentioned above (Compliance ID: 2302004-2). References for further information can be found at the provided links. The scan was initiated on July 1, 2025 at 08:40:12 and the results were generated at 08:40:39.

 On July 1st, 2025 at 08:40:12, a system scan was performed with Compliance ID 2302003. The issue detected was the lack of a separate partition for the /var/log directory. This is a low severity issue that affects compliance with multiple standards including CIS (1.1.5.1, 6.4), ISO 27001-2013 (A.12.4.1), PCI DSS v3.2.1 (10.7), SOC 2 (A1.1), and Mitre ATT&CK frameworks (TA0005, T1499, T1499.001, M1022). The problem can be mitigated by creating a separate partition for /var/log as per the provided references.

 The summary presents two system recommendations with low severity, both aimed at enhancing security according to various compliance standards.

1. Ensure a separate partition exists for the /var directory: This recommendation aligns with several compliance frameworks including CIS (Critical Security Controls), HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), ISO 27001, MITRE ATT&CK, NIST SP 800-53, PCI DSS, and SOC 2. The purpose is to prevent unauthorized access or modification of important system data in the /var directory.

Ensure separate partition exists for /var - This recommendation aligns with various standards including CIS Level 1 and 2, NIST SP 800-53, PCI DSS versions 3.2.1 and 4.0, SOC 2, and ISO 27001-2013. It is also relevant to Mitre's Tactics (TA0006) and Techniques (T1499, T1499.001). The related references are provided at the given links.

2. Ensure prelink is disabled - This recommendation is in compliance with various standards such as CIS Level 1, NIST SP 800-53, PCI DSS versions 3.2.1 and 4.0, SOC 2, and ISO 27001-2013. It is also related to Mitre's Tactics (TA0002), Techniques (T1055, T1055.009, T1065, T1065.001) and Mitigations (M1050). The relevant references can be found at the provided links.

 The compliance report indicates that the system should have nftables installed to ensure low severity PCI DSS requirements, CIS controls, NIST SP 800-53, Mitre ATT&CK tactics and techniques, ISO 27001, SOC 2, and CMMC v2.0 standards are met. The recommended action is to check if nftables is installed on the system. The report includes several references for further reading on these standards and mitigations related to this issue. The report was generated during a scan at 06/01/2025, 09:35:33 and referenced multiple resources including PCI DSS v4.0, CIS controls v8, NIST SP 800-53 R5 Upd1 Final, Mitre ATT&CK tactics TA0011, techniques T1562, T1562.004, and others.

 The system report outlines two compliance checks, each with a low severity level. The first check (ID: 2302006) pertains to ensuring the bootloader password is set. This requirement is stipulated by several standards such as CIS Level 1.4.1, CIS CSC v8.5.2, and PCI DSS v4.0 2.2.2, 8.3.5, 8.3.6, and 8.6.3, among others. References for this check can be found on various websites like the PCI DSS v4.0 documentation, MITRE ATT&CK tactics, techniques, and mitigations, and CIS Level 7 and 8 controls. The second check (ID: 2302005) concerns ensuring a separate partition exists for /home. This requirement is also specified by the SOC 2 CC6.1 standard. Both checks were conducted during the scan on June 1, 2025, at 09:35:33 and their statuses should be reviewed accordingly.

 On June 1st, 2025 at 09:35:33 and 09:35:49, two compliance checks were conducted. The first check (compliance ID: 2302004) addressed the issue of ensuring a separate partition exists for /var/log/audit. This is relevant to multiple standards such as CIS v1.1.6.1, CIS v8.3 and v7.6, ISO 27001-2013 A.12.4.1, MITRE Mitigations M1038, Tactics TA0005, Techniques T1499 and T1499.001, NIST SP 800-53 AC-5 and AC-6, PCI DSS v3.2.1 7.1, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3, and SOC 2 CC5.2. The recommended references for further information are available at the links provided. The severity of this issue was low.

   The second check did not specify a description but addressed the requirement to ensure that a separate partition exists for sensitive files or directories (e.g., /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow). This is relevant to various standards such as CIS v7.6.4, ISO 27001-2013 A.12.4.1, MITRE Mitigations M1022, Tactics TA0005, Techniques T1499 and T1499.001, PCI DSS v3.2.1 10.7, and SOC 2 A1.1.
